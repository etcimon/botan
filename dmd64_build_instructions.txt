Cannot proceed with current build: DMD64 is required.
This is due to the fact that compiling with --arch=x86_64 on Windows will use too much memory.

You can build your copy of DMD64 using the following steps: 
- Download VisualStudio 2013 Community Edition
- Download the DMD 2.067 source OR clone from GitHub repository.
- Start VS 2013.
- Open solution dmd_msc_vs10.sln (in folser src)
- Right click solution dmd_msc_vs10 and select Properties.
- Change Configuration to Release and Platform to x64.
- Right click solution dmd_msc_vs10 and select Rebuild.
- Result is 64bit dmd_msc.exe in folder.
- Copy dmd_msc.exe to dmd.exe in your bin folder
